## FEATURE:

Implement an AI-Powered CRM for a Pre-Settlement Funding Business.
The system will serve as a specialized internal tool to manage and automate the lead-to-contract lifecycle. It will manage core entities (Plaintiffs, Law Firms, Lawyers) through a sophisticated multi-agent architecture, where specialized agents collaborate to handle distinct tasks. The key differentiator is the deep integration of AI-powered agents for lead intake parsing, automated communications, document information extraction, underwriting assistance, and contract generation. The system will integrate seamlessly with Pipedrive CRM for data synchronization and workflow enhancement. The ultimate goal is to increase efficiency, reduce manual data entry, and accelerate the process from initial inquiry to a securely signed funding agreement.
the system will have its own dedicated ui which will be easy to use for the employees and work seamlessly with the multi-agent architecture and pipedrive.

Lead Intake Coordinator Agent – Manages the entire lead intake process from submission to first contact.
